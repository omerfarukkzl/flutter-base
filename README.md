**Base App Template - Flutter Starter Project**

This repository is the **Base App Template** I created to provide a solid starting point for Flutter projects. It includes a well-organized structure using the MVVM architecture, state management with Riverpod, Firebase integration, and multi-language support with EasyLocalization. Here's what the project includes and what I've worked on:

### **Key Features**
1. **Authentication**  
   - Includes Sign In and Sign Up flows.  
   - Firebase Authentication is integrated.  
   - Google Sign-In functionality is implemented.  

2. **Localization**  
   - Supports multiple languages using EasyLocalization.  
   - Localization keys are managed centrally through `locale_keys.g.dart`.  

3. **MVVM Architecture**  
   - Organized to separate business logic from UI using the MVVM pattern.  
   - Enhances code maintainability and scalability.  

4. **State Management with Riverpod**  
   - Reactive and scalable state management for better performance and modularity.  

5. **Reusable Widgets**  
   - Common UI components such as buttons, text fields, custom bottom sheets, and toast messages.  

6. **Firebase Integration**  
   - Fully configured for Firebase Authentication, Realtime Database, Firestore, and Storage.  

7. **Routing**  
   - Declarative navigation implemented using GoRouter.  

8. **Custom Utilities**  
   - Extensions for context, media query, and scaffold messenger for streamlined development.  
   - Mixins for handling form states.
